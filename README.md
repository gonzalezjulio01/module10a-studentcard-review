# Module 10A
## StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This assignment reviews the StudentCard React component. I added inline comments to explain how props are passed into the component, how state is used with the useState hook, and how the toggle button shows/hides the bio.

## What I Learned
- How props allow a parent component (App.jsx) to send data to a child component.
- How to use the useState hook to manage dynamic values (like toggling text).
- How conditional rendering works in React with `&&`.
- How to document React code with meaningful comments.
